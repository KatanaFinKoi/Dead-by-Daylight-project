                <p>
                    Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game where four players each assume the role of a 
                    determined survivor and one player takes on the role of a bloodthirsty killer. The survivors must collaborate 
                    to repair generators and unlock an exit gate all while evading capture. The killer's goal is to hunt down the 
                    survivors and sacrifice them on a sacrificial hook to appease a mysterious entity.
                </p>

                            Evan MacMillan idolised his father. It wasn't just that he was heir to a great fortune, it was the way he ran the estate. Raised under his firm hand, Evan had taken to running the workforce with an iron hand. Production was always high and the MacMillan Estate prospered under father and son.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Archie MacMillan's mental health slowly disintegrated, Evan protected him from the herd who wanted a piece of the fortune. No matter what his father asked of him, Evan would do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Archie MacMillan finally snapped, Evan became his enforcer in what would become known as the worst mass murder in modern history. They never proved that Evan lead over a hundred men into those dark tunnels before detonating the explosives and sealing them to their fate. The tale of the MacMillan Estate is a tale of wealth and power gone very wrong.

                            How many victims fell to the hands of father and son is unknown. No record is ever made of what became of Evan MacMillan. His father is another unsolved puzzle, found trapped in the locked basement of his own warehouse - starved and abandoned.

                            Philip Ojomo came to this country without anything than hope for a new beginning. He was happy as he got offered a job at Autohaven Wreckers. A small scrap yard where bribed cops turned a blind eye for the somewhat shady business that took place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ojomo didn't care. He had seen criminal activity up close in his homeland and as long as he didn't get involved, he let things be. He just fixed cars and handled the crusher. Something he did really well. A car went in and a small, metallic cube came out.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was not until one gloomy day that he, just by accident, saw some blood coming from one of the un-crushed cars. As he opened the trunk he found a young man, gagged and with tied hands with panic filled eyes. Ojomo freed the man who managed to run ten feet before Ojomo's boss stopped him and slit his throat. As Ojomo demanded answers he got explained to him that he'd been nothing more than a simple executioner as more or less every car had a soul in them as this was a "service" the scrap yard provided to certain "clients".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ojomo snapped and went ballistic. He threw his boss in the crusher and let it slowly compress, as the head stuck out, Ojomo grabbed it and pulled head and spine out of the body. Then he left and was never seen again.

                            The son of wealthy landowners Max Thompson Sr. and Evelyn Thompson, this unnamed boy was an unwanted child born to savage parents. Hideously disfigured, he was shut away from society. So ashamed of their son, they bricked him off into a room and fed him through a hole in the wall. When the boy escaped, he took his revenge savagely and terribly, slaughtering the parents that had tortured him instead of raising him.

                            After the deed was done, he continued to live his life at the farm, taking out his deranged violence on the animals that were allowed to run free. As he finally broke free from his shackles he ran through the cornfields, chasing and slaughtering whatever he could find. They never found the bodies of Max and Evelyn, but they did find tortured and disembowelled animals all over the farm.

                            Coldwind Farm was quickly settled and the land split up and sold off. There was never a buyer for the farmhouse. Perhaps it was the sound of the chainsaw you could hear throughout those hot summer nights.

                            Sally Smithson came to town with dreams of children's feet and laughter in a wooden home built by her husband Andrew. But life came not with smiles but with plans of destruction. Andrew worked as a lumberjack - a job with its perils. One day, Andrew's foreman had to pay Sally a visit, forever changing her life. She was alone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Without food on the table and no other option, Sally had to find a way, but the only employment she could get was at the Crotus Prenn Asylum. Nobody sought employment there unless they were in dire need. Just like Sally. Without any education, she started at the bottom, doing the hard night shift.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, her mind had reached its limits, two decades of seeing horrid things that violate the eyes. Memories that are re-played every night. Being abused verbally and physically, by people without limits. Sally saw insanity from the outside, just to catch it herself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally she could not take it any more and concepts of purification emerged inside her. She did what she felt was necessary. As the morning staff arrived one day in September - they found over fifty dead patients, lifeless, in their bed along four staff members, also dead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Only Sally had survived the night, but her mind was gone, rocking back and forth non-stop. Exactly what happened is only known by her, but it seems that some of them had been choked as they had marks around their necks. They got her into an ambulance, but that ambulance never reached the hospital. It was found crashed in a nearby wood, all the staff dead and Sally nowhere to be found.

                    <div class="block-of-text">
                        <p>
                            From an early age, Herman Carter understood the human psyche. To analyse and de-construct something as powerful as the brain intrigued him. He was an apt pupil and gained the attention of his teachers. He excelled in high-school and was published in "Partisan" — a psychology gazette. Within a year, Carter was fast-tracked into Yale's advanced neuroscience programme, really a front for the CIA. Brainpower is a must if you're about to conquer the world and demolish foes across the pond. The CIA understood this, so interrogation and intelligence became their number one priority. All they needed were brilliant people — like Carter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Carter and other top-tier recruits were transferred off-campus and into a secret black site facility in Illinois known as Léry's Memorial Institute. A protégé craves a mentor, and that's where Dr Otto Stamper stepped in, who taught Carter that information is everything and knowledge is power. He was given all instruments needed, a guiding hand, and more or less everything he asked for. He never realised that sunlight had started to become so scarce, that he too was kept in the dark. Because knowledge doesn't only give you power, it also transforms you into a threat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To extract information was his mission. Dr Stamper encouraged Carter to go further and not to consider this a normal medical facility — no eyes were watching them, there were no rules to abide. The agency just pointed Carter in the right direction, then he started to take a few steps back as he saw how Carter could walk on his own. Docile test subjects were exchanged for real, live spies. People that played a role in the troubles outside the facility. Carter shouldered this new role — Project Awakening took form, and on paper Carter described it as "experimental interrogation". It was approved and over a few months, nobody knocked on his door. Screams and moans filled the corridor outside his lab, but wars skew people and what they accept — as long as the enemy is kept at bay. The fluorescent lights flickered more and more often. Electro-convulsive Treatment became a standard dish on the menu. Prisoners held at the facility begged the guards to take them to any other lab but Carter's. Rumours were disregarded in the beginning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, Carter became known as The Doctor and no one ever questioned if he had even held a medical certificate or even what happened to the prisoners after they had given up their information. It was only after the Léry's Memorial Institute went silent for a week that they finally uncovered the true horror of what had happened there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Carter's experimental information extraction had turned to horrific and bizarre torture. Patients and prisoners were found dead or in vegetative states with all types of head trauma. In his office, they found the most terrible discovery of all. Dr Stamper himself, his head peeled open and an array of electrodes and sensors inserted into his still working, but annihilated brain. There was no sign of Herman "The Doctor" Carter, but his research papers suggested that he had been using the prisoners as part of awful ECT experiments as he searched for the panacea of mind control.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The government didn't want to know. The black site was condemned and all knowledge of the Léry's Memorial Institute redacted forever.

                            Some humans are simply bad seeds. Seeds infused with a distilled and pure form of evil.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Michael Myers is one of those seeds. He had no issues with causing the pain of others. Instead, it was exactly what he sought. But even life can be tough on those with minds filled with terror. The difference is just how one goes about to solve those problems. For Michael, he had to kill to find some inner peace. As he took his sister’s life, the police found a silent boy dressed as a clown at the scene.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When one stumbles upon a growing fire, one does not pour gasoline on it. But this was an action taken by officials that had no idea how it would shape this demon in the boy's body. Sending Michael to a mental institution was a feeble attempt to save the child. Unsuccessful therapy and nightly screams just made him even more introverted and deranged.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People hoped that Michael Myers would end up a parenthesis, soon to be forgotten and buried, a failure that soon were to rot away. But then...he escaped.

                            Dwight was geeky and scrawny through high school. He always wanted to be one of the cool kids, but somehow never had the charisma. He tried out for the football team but was cut, the basketball team didn't even take a look, and his grades were distinctly below average. One weekend, on a team-building exercise from his dead-end job, Dwight's boss led them deep into the woods before breaking out his family recipe moonshine. Dwight remembered taking the first sip before waking up late the next morning all alone. During the night, the others had abandoned him. Once again, the laughing stock of the community Dwight tried to hike his way out of the woods. That was the last anyone ever heard of Dwight Fairfield.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dwight isn't the typical guy you think of when someone says "Survivor". He lacks that certain pizzazz and without his glasses, he's more or less blind. But as the sun sets and the woods come alive, Dwight clasps to his rat race life, making sure that he'll live to see another day even though something unimaginable is after him. Dwight won't stop. He'll survive no matter what. As others spent hours being seen in high school. He spent hours becoming invisible and avoiding danger. And it doesn't matter if it's dangers in the hallway or dangers in the woods. Survival is key. As other employees panic when terror infects them, Dwight makes use of his disturbing teen experience. The tables have now turned and now others need to follow to Dwight's firm directions if they are to survive as he knows how to disappear.

                            Perhaps it was her mother that had instilled the fierce streak in her or maybe it was her father that left them when she was a baby. Meg excelled at schoolwork but she was off the rails. Fortunately, an athletics coach encouraged her to channel her misspent energy on the track. She motivated herself into becoming a high school star and earned a scholarship to college. When her mother fell ill, Meg decided to give up her chance at college to care for the woman who had raised her. One summer's day, on a long run deep in the woods, Meg vanished. Search as they did, they never found her body.

                        <p>
                            Meg is one of those who is just simply filled with energy. Unfocused and uncontrollable energy that had to come out. As a kid it came through rowdiness and rebellion. Someone had to focus Meg before something went terribly wrong. Fortunately, someone did. She started to run. Maybe from something undefined that fueled her energy. So to run equaled life. But to run now might attract those beings that crave the pain of others. But as she runs from something, instead of towards it, she understands something. She understands that speed is not of the essence. It’s reaching that finish line. Rather last but still breathing. She deludes whatever is out there as she glides through obstacles and fear, thus managing to stay alive.

                            From the day that her parents gave Claudette her first science kit, she loved experiments. Her single-minded pursuit lead to an early scholarship at a great college. It was a huge decision to leave Montreal, but the chance was too good to pass up. Her introverted nature means that chat rooms and forums are now her best source of social interaction. Her new favourite activity is to answer botany questions for others under her new moniker of Science Girl. One evening, during a long bus ride back from the city, Claudette took a stroll that would change her life. It only took a minute for her to get completely disoriented in the thick woods. She never found her way back. Her forum only started to wonder where she was a week after she stopped posting.

                            Claudette is not the outgoing type. Her brilliance provided her with a social handicap and she has fled the real world for chat rooms and forums. Botany and studies fill her life and even though she yearns for something else - it won’t come via a modem. Being thrown into a real-life situation can feel awkward and forced. But as she is used to shutting out the world, she suddenly finds hope in this inexplicable darkness that is slowly devouring her. A plant. A tree. A bush. Simple greenery that might save a life. She hides within and amongst them. Her knowledge and skills flourish as gruesomeness roams free around her.

                            Growing up the son of a wealthy CEO was always going to put pressure on Jake Park. When his brother graduated with honours from Yale, the pressure on Jake intensified. Jake just wasn't the academic type, but his father never really understood his refusal to embrace the expensive education he lavished upon him. Eventually, Jake rebelled by dropping out of school entirely. Now, Jake lives off the grid on the edge of the woods. It's been years since he spoke to his father but his mother checks in once in a while. It was she, who eventually called the police. The cops said he got lost in the woods and a search party looked for days, but gave up as bad weather rolled in. Despite passionate pleas from his mother, they never resumed the search and Jake went down in history as another casualty of the woods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Jake's destiny was set even inside his mother's womb. Heir to wealth, noble manners and caretaker of the family reputation and legacy. During torture it's not pain that breaks a man, it's immense pressure. And Jake couldn't handle any more pressure. Instead he sought the opposite of fine dining and maids. He left the grid and ended up with a forest as closest neighbour. A self made outsider, Jake understands nature. He's not there to tame something - rather him becoming feral. Remove the brutal Killers that seek out blood to drain and Jake would feel just at home. No Wi-Fi. No Fortune-500 companies. No father or mother. Years away from modern life has given Jake a new feel for problems. Pain is just an obstacle that hinders you from getting fed. No matter what is hunting you, you need to stay one step ahead. Struggle, blend in, adapt. Just don’t make it easy for others to erase you from the Earth's surface.

                            Nea is of Swedish descent, a tagger and a bit of a troublemaker. She started rebelling when she was 16, she dyed her hair black and cut it in a way she liked it. In her early teens, her parents thought she lacked that thing that makes everyone else "normal". She may have gone too far when her friends, not thinking well, dared her to tag the old asylum. She was never seen again, and now tries her best to survive the Entity's dangers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Nea grew up in the small town of Hjo in Sweden. She had a happy childhood even though her mom and dad worked hard. As the opportunity to move to the US became a reality she started acting out. Her parents didn’t really pick up on this as a reaction to their move. Nea was forced to leave her friends and life behind. Nea shied away from what her parents considered “normal”. Instead she took refuge in skate parks, and her tag “Mashtyx” was seen more or less all over her new hometown, and Nea made a sport out of tagging government buildings. Finally Nea’s parents became used to Nea disappearing for a few days on end. As she’s nimble and almost catlike, she’s able to evade deadly dangers. Years on skateboards has proven worthy training. And keeping her head down, avoiding the fuzz can be applied to all dangers. The only question is whether she has some interest in not giving up.

                            You never know what really matters in life until you've realised it might end soon. Laurie is one of those who just wants a quiet life in the suburbs, hanging out with friends, family and maybe go on a date or two. Laurie is a typical teenager. You could pass her on the street and not think twice. She does her homework and is liked by her friends, teachers and family. A simple night of babysitting turns into something that will forever change the course of her young life. A knife swooshing through the air. Screams from afar. Noises that plays tricks with her mind. But not Laurie, she’s made of something stronger. Something that won't give up.

                    <h3 class="lore-section-header">The Trials</h3>

                    <h4 class="lore-subheader">What Are the Trials?</h4>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        In Dead by Daylight, the Trials are life-and-death games orchestrated by a cosmic, malevolent being known as The Entity. These Trials take place in various grim, surreal environments drawn from both the memories and experiences of its chosen victims. Each Trial pits four Survivors against a Killer, with the Survivors attempting to escape while the Killer hunts them down.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="lore-subheader">Why Do the Trials Happen?</h4>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        The Trials are essentially a form of worship for The Entity, which feeds on strong emotions—specifically hope and despair. By placing Survivors in terrifying scenarios where they are constantly teetering between escape and death, The Entity cultivates an endless cycle of emotional torment that sustains its existence. The stronger the emotions generated during the Trials, the more The Entity thrives.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        The Trials are not random; they are carefully orchestrated for the following reasons:
                    </p>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        Feeding on Fear: The Survivors' fear and despair during the Trials serve as nourishment for The Entity.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        Breaking Hope: While Survivors may feel hope when they escape or outsmart a Killer, this hope is ultimately crushed as they are returned to The Entity's grasp for another Trial, ensuring they can never truly escape.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        Testing and Corruption: The Trials act as tests for both the Survivors and Killers. The Entity often corrupts individuals (such as the Killers) to do its bidding, rewarding them for their loyalty with power while binding them eternally to its will.

                    <h3 class="lore-section-header">About the Entity</h3>

                    <h4 class="lore-subheader">What Is The Entity?</h4>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        The Entity is a mysterious and otherworldly being that exists beyond human comprehension. It resides in a realm outside of time and space, referred to as The Entity's Realm, where it manipulates reality to create the environments and rules for its Trials.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="lore-subheader">Nature and Purpose</h4>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        The Entity's primary purpose is to feed on emotions—specifically, the juxtaposition of hope and despair. Its hunger drives all of its actions, from abducting Survivors and Killers to creating horrific landscapes. It is neither good nor evil in the human sense; it simply exists to sustain itself, much like a predator in nature.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="lore-section">
                    <h3 class="lore-section-header">How Does It Operate?</h3>
                    <h4 class="lore-subheader">Abduction and Corruption:</h4>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        The Entity selects individuals from different timelines and realities, pulling them into its realm. 
                        Survivors are often ordinary people with no prior connection to each other, while Killers are often individuals 
                        with dark pasts who are more susceptible to The Entity's influence.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        The Entity manipulates Killers into its service, amplifying their violent tendencies and rewarding them with power 
                        in exchange for their loyalty.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="lore-subheader">Creation of the Trials:</h4>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        The Entity crafts each Trial by pulling elements from the memories, fears, or defining moments of its victims. 
                        For example, many Trial maps are based on significant locations from the Survivors' or Killers' pasts, 
                        designed to evoke strong emotional reactions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        The Entity sets rules for the Trials (e.g., the requirement to hook Survivors or power Exit Gates), 
                        but these are ultimately arbitrary constructs meant to create a sense of struggle and futility.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="lore-subheader">The Fog:</h4>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        The Entity's realm is shrouded in a dense fog, which serves as both a physical manifestation of its influence 
                        and a means of limiting visibility during the Trials. The fog also acts as a boundary, preventing escape 
                        from its domain.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="lore-subheader">Sacrifice to The Entity:</h4>
                    <p class="lore-p">
                        The ultimate goal for Killers is to hook Survivors, allowing The Entity to claim them. When a Survivor is hooked 
                        three times or dies during the Trial, The Entity manifests to consume their essence. This "sacrifice" 
                        is a direct offering that fuels The Entity's power.
